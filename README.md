# sandbox

I use this repository to practice and explore things I don’t fully understand yet.

## Purpose

This repository is a personal sandbox for notes, small experiments, and ideas that do not belong to a production project.

## Projects

A collection of small, runnable sandbox projects.

### json-pretty

- Pretty-print a JSON file
- Run -> `cd projects/json-pretty && npm install && npm run pretty`

### slugify
